Enjoy a random Giant Floating Baby Head

The Giant Floating Baby Head extension makes a baby head randomly cross the browser window for any site. It's a great prank to install on someone's Chrome who's a fan of "Phineas and Ferb." Never heard of it? Check out:

Want an image other than the Baby Head? Enter your own image on the Extension Options page. It could be Worf, a Creeper, Donald Trump, etc. The possibilities are endless.

The Giant Floating Baby Head appears at random (every 10-40 minutes after opening a new tab), or according to the settings set on the options page (open Manage Extensions, click on the 'Details' button for the extension, and select 'Extension options').
You can also trigger the appearance manually by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F (configurable) on almost any webpage! (Chrome restricts it from running on certain pages.)

### Updates:
- Click the baby head!
- Supports multiple, user-defined image URLs
- Configure the keyboard shortcut
- Configure which websites the GFBH should not appear on
- Configure duration

Make sure to check out the options page. More settings and options to come.
